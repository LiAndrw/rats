# Design Rationale
Initially, we thought of creating a scatter plot to visualize the variations in temperature/activity level of male mice and female mice on estrus day and non-estrus day. and  with each point representing an individual mouse. However, we later decided that a line plot would be more effective in highlighting the overall trends. ……


We had a group meeting on Discord to brainstorm project ideas together. After finalizing our approach, we divided the tasks among our team members. Andrew was responsible for data preprocessing, handling aggregations and formatting the dataset to fit our needs. Junhao designed and implemented the interactive visualizations, with Zifan assisting in the process. Zifan also wrote the project write-up. The actual development of the interactive visualizations was the part that took us the majority of the time. Junhao spent nearly 5 hours composing and testing the code.
